#### Background:

Madrid's City Hall have introduced new restrictions on traffic in the heart of the capital. This measurement was aligned with the air quality strategy for reducing the high values of pollution were matched last years in the town.

<br/>

#### Lifetime:
* **30th nov 2018**: Started
* **1st jul-30th sep 2019**: Admitted moratorium for citizens from 1-8th jul 2019.
* **Jul 2019**: Europe commission sentence Spain for: systematically violate “legal nitrogen dioxide (NO2) limits.

<br/>

#### Main points:
472 hectares of the city center off-limits to traffic
except for local residents and public transportation
Non-residents with appropriate energy labels
exceptions are made for people with reduced mobility, ambulances, taxis, private-hire cars and delivery vans
Electric vehicles will also be allowed
Map restriction:

<br/>

#### Expectation:
Looking at the adverse air quality situation in Madrid, we conduct a new visualization of tropospheric NO2 via spatial and temporal scale by analysing satellite images.
NO2 has been monitored by satellite since 1995 with GOME, since 2002 with SCIAMACHY, and since 2004 with the OMI instrument; the latest two instruments having the disadvantage of a low spatial resolution.

As the last satellite, Sentinel 5p is in charged to monitor the atmosphere conditions launched in October 2017, and this one has 6 times resolution more than the last ones.
This is an experiment aiming at giving more transparency to the Madrid’s city managers for a better decision making for green policies according pollution trends.

RESULTS (briefly documented app along time, WHAT DO WE EXPECT FROM):

* [The	Use	of	Satellite	Data	to	Assist	AQ	Policy

#### Workflow
* Download vector layer (neightborhoods, buildings)
* Download sahpefile of “zona restringida de trafico”
* GEE- extract NO2 and others
* Vectorizing all the tiffs
