**Air-Panel** is an efficient air quality indicator panel based on satellite and ground sensor data, for regional and local policy makers. **Air-Panel** is a platform which provides comprehensive data and imagery on air-pollution and is meant to serve as a toolbox for air quality risk planning and to launch and grow successful action plans. It also provides individual cities and ports with a measure of climate change adaptability.

We work on the following case study called **GreenPort**.

-------

#### Background:

Did you know that the most of our import products are transported over sea? As a result, shipping is positioned as the 6th largest on the list of the world's biggest polluters by country.

<br/>

#### Understand the issue:
Reducing port pollution is a top priority for many governments. However, it leads to significant costs to adapt the shipping sector to meet the current environmental requirements and is often politically challenging. So the first step is to quantify the problem and to fully understand the type and sources of pollution. To do that an air quality monitoring program must be put into action.

#### Case study:
Looking at the adverse air quality situation in harbors, we conduct a new visualization of tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub> on a spatial and temporal scale by analyzing satellite images. NO<sub>2</sub> has been monitored by satellites since 1995 with GOME, since 2002 with SCIAMACHY, and since 2004 with the OMI instrument. These instruments had the disadvantage of a low spatial resolution. The newest satellite, Sentinel 5p, that is in charge to monitor atmosphere conditions, was launched in October 2017. It has a 6 times higher spatial resolution than is predecessor. This makes it possible to come up with a lot of new information on air quality in harbors on a day-to-day scale.
