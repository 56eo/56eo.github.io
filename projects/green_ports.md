**Air-Panel** efficient Air quality indicator panel based in satellite and ground sensor data for regional and local managers. **Air-Panel** displays indicator values with imagery that gives comprehensive data for air quality risk planning to launch and grow successful actionable plans. This is a measure of climate change adaption.

We work in the following case study called **GreenPort**.

-------

#### Background:

Did you know that the most of our visible trade in the main Port Cities comes to us by sea? If we put shipping emissions on the list of the world's biggest polluters by country, shipping would be positioned as the sixth largest.

<br/>

#### Understand the issue:
Reducing port pollution is a top priority for many governments, however it can incur significant cost and is often politically challenging. So the first step is to quantify the problem and to fully understand the type and sources of pollution. To do that an air quality monitoring program must be put into action.

<br/>

#### Case study:
Looking at the adverse air quality situation in harbors, we conduct a new visualization of tropospheric NO2 via spatial and temporal scale by analyzing satellite images.
NO2 has been monitored by satellite since 1995 with GOME, since 2002 with SCIAMACHY, and since 2004 with the OMI instrument; the latest two instruments having the disadvantage of a low spatial resolution.

As the last satellite, Sentinel 5p is in charged to monitor the atmosphere conditions launched in October 2017, and this one has 6 times spatial resolution more than the last ones.
This is an experiment aiming at giving more transparency to the Ports managers for a better decision making for green policies according pollution trends.
