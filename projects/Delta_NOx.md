**Air-Panel** is an efficient Air quality indicator panel based on satellite and ground sensor data for regional and local managers. **Air-Panel** displays indicator values with imagery that gives comprehensive data for air quality risk planning to launch and grow successful actionable plans. This is a measure of climate change adaption.

We work in the following case study called **Delta NOx**.

-------

#### Background:

The nitrogen levels in the Netherlands have consistently exceeded European maximum levels, due to a high population density, traffic intensity and agricultural production. In 2019 this lead to the so called nitrogen-crisis, which immediately required political actions like reducing the maximum speed from 130 to 100 km/h on all highways, putting a stop on building activities and trying to reduce nitrogen hydroxide emissions in the agricultural sector. These strict measurements resulted farmers and builders protests, who were doubting the air-quality measurements that were done based on ground-sensors.

#### Case study:
In this project we provide improved spatial-temporal information on Nox levels at every location of the Netherlands by translating satellite-based pollution data to ground-level values.

<br/>

#### Delta NOx lifetime:
* **October 2019**: Start of project.
* **October 2019**: Stop is put on all building activities in the Netherlands.
* **November 2019**: A new law reducing the traffic speed to 100 km/h is passed through government.
