**Air-Panel** is an efficient air quality indicator panel based on satellite and ground sensor data, for regional and local policy makers. **Air-Panel** is a platform which provides comprehensive data and imagery on air-pollution and is meant to serve as a toolbox for air quality risk planning and to launch and grow successful action plans. It also provides individual cities and ports with a measure of climate change adaptability.

We work on the following case study called **Delta NO<sub>x</sub>**.

-------

#### Background:

The nitrogen levels in the Netherlands have consistently exceeded European maximum levels, due to a high population density, traffic intensity and agricultural production. In 2019 this lead to the so called nitrogen-crisis, which immediately required political actions like reducing the maximum speed from 130 to 100 km/h on all highways, putting a stop on building activities and trying to reduce ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) deposition and atmosphere emission in the agricultural sector. These strict measurements resulted in protests among farmers and builders, who were also doubting the validity of air-quality ground-sensor measurements that were done by the RIVM (National Institute for Public Health and the Environment).

#### Case study:
In this project we provide improved spatial-temporal information on No<sub>x</sub> levels at every location of the Netherlands by translating satellite-based pollution data to ground-level values.
NO<sub>2</sub> has been monitored by satellites since 1995 with GOME, since 2002 with SCIAMACHY, and since 2004 with the OMI instrument. These instruments had the disadvantage of a low spatial resolution. The newest satellite, Sentinel 5p, that is in charge to monitor atmosphere conditions, was launched in October 2017. It has a 6 times higher spatial resolution than is predecessor. This makes it possible to come up with a lot of new information on the NO<sub>2</sub> levels in the Netherlands.
We verify the processed data with ground-sensor data from the Pandora spectrometers and compare it with the data that the RIVM  provides.

#### Delta NO<sub>x</sub> lifetime:
* **May 2019**: Court ruling of the Council of State puts stop or severe delay on many building activities in the Netherlands, because of harmful nitrogen emissions.
* **September 2019**: First advice rapport Nitrogen Commission Remkes on Nitrogen problem in the Netherlands is published.
* **October 2019**: Start of Delta NO<sub>x</sub> project.
* **November 2019**: A new law reducing the traffic speed to 100 km/h is passed through government.
* **December 2019**: The Dutch government will introduce new plans to reduce nitrogen on the long haul. Second advice Nitrogen Commission Remkes expected.
